		<span class="green-text">What: </span>
ores list with other members of the  Ironscape community. After users sign up, the bot then creates an API request to fetch the highscores from the games developer's API. It will also refresh the entire database of users every 12 hours. It also has some backend functionality to help moderate the server. As of July 25th, 2020 there are over 300 people signed up to use this bot.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="portfolio-text">
		<span class="green-text">How: </span>
	Users use commands within a specific channel of the discord server that allows them to add, change, or delete themselves from the highscores. It also allows users to view the top 25 people of each category of skills, bosses or more by printing out an embedded message</p><br>

	<br>
	<p class="portfolio-text">
		<span class="green-text">Future Development:</span>
		In the future I plan to add pagination, implement an application process ranks/roles in our in game communities, a stand alone website, and additional achievement highscores that the developer's API does not cover.

	<p class="portfolio-text">
		<span class="green-text">What: </span>
	Creating a clone of a fictional news website from an image.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="portfolio-text">
		<span class="green-text">How: </span>
	This project was done in 3 stages. The first stage was to take the text and images I was given and insert them into html as a skeleton. For stage 2, I applied basic CSS to create a basic, live wireframe of the site (floating elements, making responsive). Stage 3 added colors, fonts and a responsive navigation bar. These Layers were added on top of another so that by the end of the project it matched the initial screenshot given as closely as possible.</p>
