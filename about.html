<p class="portfolio-text">Hi! I am a 26 year old web developer born and raised in Raleigh, NC. I have always been fascinated by computers ever sine I was a child. They've always represented the future and have always amazed me of what they are capable of. I always knew that I wanted to work with computers, but it took an old job and building my own computer to push me into pursuing it through a degree in web development</p>
<br>
<p class="portfolio-text">I used to work as a merchandiser for Coca Cola bottling Co. driving around to stores in the area and stocking their shelves with Coke products. It paid well, but it had long hours and the company was severely understaffed of merchandisers with all the stores growing and new stores opening in the area. Right after leaving, I decided to give myself a birthday present and build myself a new computer. Reasearching all the components, their compatibility, and knowing I didn't want another manual labor job led to me signing up for a web development certificate program and then pursuing a degree from Wake Tech.</p>
<br>
<p class="portfolio-text">Learning how to code has been one of the most difficult and rewarding things I've pursued in my life and I'm learning new things every day. I particurlarly enjoy finding and fixing bugs in projects quickly, learning new languages, and working with teams to achieve large goals. I look forward to being a part of what the future of web and software development will bring to all of us.</p>
